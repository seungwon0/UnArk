	UNARJ LICENSE POLICY FOR ALL USERS:

	The UNARJ program, source code, and the associated documentation
	are copyright (c) 1990-2000 ARJ Software, Inc. all rights reserved.

	If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
	distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

	README.DOC
	UNARJ.EXE
	UNARJ.DOC
	UNARJ.C
	DECODE.C
	ENVIRON.C
	UNARJ.H
	UNARJ.DEF
	TCCUNARJ.MAK
	BCCUNARJ.MAK
	BCC32.MAK
	QCLUNARJ.MAK
	OS2UNARJ.MAK
	TECHNOTE.DOC

	We strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
	originally released:  UNARJ243.EXE with the ARJ-SECURITY envelope as
	created by the author.  If you must distribute the UNARJ archive in
	another archive format, please archive the UNARJ243.EXE as one file
	inside the other archive.  Re-archival of the software as separate
	files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

	You may freely use the UNARJ C source code.  If you wish to 
	distribute a modified version of UNARJ.EXE, you MUST indicate that it 
	is a modified version both in the program and source code.

	We are holding the copyright on the source code, so please do not
	delete our name from the program files or the documentation.

	The UNARJ.EXE program is built from this source using Borland C++ 3.1.

	You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ.EXE, provided that no
	fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

	You may use UNARJ.EXE in a commercial software package provided that
	no additional fee is charged for using UNARJ.EXE and provided that
	the user fully understands that NO warranty or support is provided
	for UNARJ.EXE by ARJ Software.  Moreover, the user must fully
	understand that UNARJ does not have the long usage history that ARJ
	does.

	This source code is intended to promote the building of utilities to
	support the use of ARJ and ARJ archives.
